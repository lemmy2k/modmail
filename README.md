## How Does Modmail Work?

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GGukNDs.png" align="right" height="350">

When a user sends a direct message to the bot, a channel is created within an isolated category. This channel is where messages will be relayed. To reply to the message, simply use the command `?reply` in the channel. A full list of commands can be found by using the `?help` command.

## Features

* Aesthetic command interfaces e.g Pagination via reactions
* Highly Customisable:
  * Bot activity, prefix, etc.
  * Command permissions
  * Interface elements (color, responses, reactions, etc.)
  * Snippets and *command aliases*
  * Minimum account/guild age in order to create a thread.
* Scheduled closing - e.g. `?close in 2 hours silently`
* Blocking users e.g. `?block @user spamming for 2 days`
* Get notified/subscribe for thread messages. (`?notify` and `?sub`)
* Linked thread messages
  * Editing/deleting a message on one end is synced with the other.
* Thread logs, e.g. https://logs.modmail.tk/example
  * When you close a thread, a log link is generated and posted to your log-channel.
  * Rendered in styled HTML like Discord.
  * Optional login in via Discord to protect your logs.
  * See past logs of a user with `?logs`
  * Searchable by text queries using `?logs search`
* Optional automatic updates to stay up to date with the latest features.
  
This list is ever growing thanks to active development and our exceptional contributors.


## Installation

### Heroku
Currently, the easiest way to set up the bot is by using Heroku, a container-based cloud platform. Installation via Heroku is done in your web browser and keeps the bot online 24/7 for free. The [**installation guide**](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail/wiki/Installation) will guide you through the entire installation process. If you run into any problems, join the [development server](https://discord.gg/etJNHCQ) for help and support. 

### Locally 
Installation locally for development reasons or otherwise is as follows, you will need `python 3.7` and `pipenv`.

Clone the repo
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail
$ cd modmail
```

Install dependancies
```console
$ pipenv install
```

Rename the `config.json.example` to `config.json` and fill out the fields. 
And finally, run the bot.
```console
$ pipenv run python3 bot.py
```
